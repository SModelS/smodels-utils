prettyPlots = both ; If True it will produce pretty plots, 'both' generates pretty and ugly plots, 'dictonly' produces the python dictionary only, no plotting (except possible ratio and best SR plots)
generateData = True ; Set to True to run SModelS on the slha files. If False, use the already existing *.py files in the validation folder. If None or 'ondemand', produce data only if none are found.
