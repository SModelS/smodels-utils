* code to port fastlim results to smodels
* code to validate the smodels-database
* code to facilitate adding new experimental results to the database
* code to create *home-grown* efficiency maps for smodels
* code to write bibtex files with all analysis results, visualise and plot simplified models, and SMS results, etc etc etc
* code to train the neural networks for database compression
* experimental code for possible new features of smodels proper
* the artificial proto-modeller
