**Welcome to the smodels-utils repository**

This is a repository to store and preserve codes and data *around* smodels that
are not actual part of smodels-proper. 
<span style="color:red">DISCLAIMER:</span> the code in this repository is public but not published and comes with no guarantees. Your mileage may vary!

Among the tools in this repository you will find:

* code to validate the smodels-database (validation, see https://smodels.github.io/docs/Validation)
* code to facilitate adding new experimental results to the database (smodels_utils/dataPreparation)

In addition this repository contains:

* code to automatically produce many of the wiki pages on https://smodels.github.io in markdown syntax
* code to port fastlim results to smodels (fastlim_tools)
* code to write bibtex files with all analysis results, visualise and plot simplified models, and SMS results, etc etc etc (a few directories)

* this current main branch is intended to work with SModelS 3.x.
