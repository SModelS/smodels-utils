* code to facilitate adding new experimental results to the database: `./smodels_utils/dataPreparation <https://github.com/SModelS/smodels-utils/tree/main/smodels_utils/dataPreparation>`_

**In addition this repository contains:**

* code to automatically produce many of the wiki pages on `https://smodels.github.io` in markdown syntax
