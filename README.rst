**Welcome to the smodels-utils repository**

This is a repository to store and preserve code and data *around* smodels that
are not actual part of smodels-proper.
Among the tools in this repository you will find:

* code to automatically produce many of the wiki pages on https://smodels.github.io in wiki syntax
* code to port fastlim results to smodels (fastlim_tools)
* code to validate the smodels-database (validation, see https://smodels.github.io/docs/Validation)
* code to facilitate adding new experimental results to the database (smodels_utils/dataPreparation)
* code to create *home-grown* efficiency maps for smodels (EM_Creator)
* code to write bibtex files with all analysis results, visualise and plot simplified models, and SMS results, etc etc etc (a few directories)
* code to train the neural networks for database compression (ml, machineLearning)
* experimental code for possible new features of smodels proper 
* the artificial proto-modeller (combinations, see https://smodels.github.io/protomodels)

* this current master branch is intended to work with SModelS 1.2.3+ and 2.x
