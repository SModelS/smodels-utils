Artificial proto-modelling
==========================

The goal of this project is to arrive at plausible precursors of the Next Standard
Model, constructed purely from data. Technically, the project consists of four
components a "builder", a "critic", a "combiner", and a "predictor".

-) a proto-model builder: a Monte-Carlo Markov Chain-type algorithm that constructs
proto-models in a random walk, arbitrarily changing the particle content of the theory,
	the masses, cross sections, and branching ratios of the hypothetical new particles.
Once a model is constructed, it is passed on to the critic.

-) the critic takes the model from the builder, and uses SModelS to confront it against
the SModelS database of simplified models results from about 100 searches. The aim 
of the critic is to reject models that are excluded by any of the plethora of results 
in the database. As a means of robustification, models that are excluded by one result
by allowed by similar, other results, will not be rejected. In case of acceptance of
the model, the critic passes the model to the combiner, alongside with the information
