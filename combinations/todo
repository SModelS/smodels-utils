-) get the distributions of K and Z by sampling the background
-) expResModifier allow it also to inject signals
-) play with flavor changing changes
-) CMS-SUS-19-006, why didnt we add eff map?
-) add smart sampling from background for UL results

-) llhd plots with signal strengths instead of LSP mass
-) use the xsec recycler also with changed ss multipliers

x) introduce a headstart mode, by scanning for the largest excesses and starting
	 with appropriate particles
x) add second gluino and third stop
.) plot the Zs also for excluded regions in scans
.) automate the plotting of the scans further, i.e automatically plot llhd plots
.) resolve muhat, the prior needs to take it into account!
.) understand the two stop enigma, more debugging tools
.) add "teleport to hiscore" step
.) parallelize llhdscanner
.) plot 68% credibility region for combination
.) plot horizontal ruler
.) llhd plots, separate ul plots and eff plots
.) in rawnumbers, show also the particles that entered
.) state.pcl: move to using dictionaries
.) llhd1000003.png and llhd1000004.png look the same. why? fix!
.) in llhd plots: plot forbidden regions (rmax > 1.7)
