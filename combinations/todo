-) add second gluino and third stop
-) understand plt1000021ATLAS-CONF-2013-062.png
-) llhd contour-only plots
-) Z plots as function of ssms
-) improve index.tex
-) use the xsec recycler also in the walker
-) use the xsec recycler also with changed ss multipliers
-) llhd plots with signal strengths instead of LSP mass
-) llhd plots, separate ul plots and eff plots
-) think of particle merging strategy in case two particles are too similar to
   each other
-) produce and add CMS-SUS-16-036 eff maps

.) plt1000021CMS-SUS-16-033, why cut of at around 1800?
.) for bestCombo, write out the raw numbers 
.) in cheat mode: first run without any random step
.) write out *all* predictions for a given analysis, dont just find bestCombo
.) better representation of ssms
.) fix hiscore.slha
.) remove unneccessary decays from mymodel.py
.) trim also ssms
