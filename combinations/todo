-) state.pcl: move to using dictionaries
-) automate the plotting of the scans further
-) maybe a few more tampering mechanisms, like swap similar particles,
	 or try susy xsec, or try ssms of other particles
-) in rawnumbers, show also the particles that entered

-) llhd plots with signal strengths instead of LSP mass
-) llhd plots, separate ul plots and eff plots
-) add second gluino and third stop
-) use the xsec recycler also with changed ss multipliers
