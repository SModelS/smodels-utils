-) plot 68% credibility region for combination
-) get the distributions of K and Z by sampling the background
-) automate the plotting of the scans further, i.e automatically plot llhd plots
-) maybe a few more tampering mechanisms, like swap similar particles,
-) CMS-SUS-19-006, why didnt we add eff map?

-) llhd plots with signal strengths instead of LSP mass
-) use the xsec recycler also with changed ss multipliers
-) add second gluino and third stop

.) llhd plots, separate ul plots and eff plots
.) in rawnumbers, show also the particles that entered
.) state.pcl: move to using dictionaries
.) llhd1000003.png and llhd1000004.png look the same. why? fix!
.) in llhd plots: plot forbidden regions (rmax > 1.7)
