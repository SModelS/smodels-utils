-) currently I cannot reproduce the Z scores. I think the upper limits results are only taken into account when running randomWalk.py, not when running e.g. trimmer.py
-) chase the Z>30 bug. I assume it is all about likelihoods being set to e.g. 1e-80 when actually zero.
-) why do upper limit results not make any impact at all?
-) add "expected" mode
