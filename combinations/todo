-) add second gluino and third stop
-) add nstep to zhistory
-) do the trimming in the walkers, not in the hiscore updater (it just takes too long there)

-) llhd contour-only plots
-) Z plots as function of ssms
-) improve index.tex
-) use the xsec recycler also in the walker
-) use the xsec recycler also with changed ss multipliers
-) llhd plots with signal strengths instead of LSP mass
-) llhd plots, separate ul plots and eff plots
-) think of particle merging strategy in case two particles are too similar to
   each other
