Models beyond the Standard Model are traditionally constructed from first principles
and hypothesized fundamental symmetries, like supersymmetry [refs], extra dimensional
models [refs], super string theories [refs], or little Higgs models [refs].
Typically, such models have been hypothesized, and experimental features and signatures
have been extracted that are common to large classes of such models. 
Such signatures have in turn been used to devise search strategies. The postulated
models have then often been falsified in a fairly classical frequentist hypothesis testing
approach. 

Seeing how the LHC collaborations failed at seeing hints of such fundamental
models in data, many theorists have recently resorted to a more pragmatic,
bottom-up approach at building BSM models. Examples of such models being
many dark matter models [refs], Higgs (inert) doublet models [refs], and similar models
that are intended to address only some but not all of the problems
mentioned that exist in theoretical particle physics, namely the problem
of the small Higgs mass (naturalness problem), the problem of our failure
to describe the particle nature of dark matter, and the problem of our
failure to understand the origin of the asymmetry between matter and
anti-matter that is prevalent in our universe.

Within this project we shall attempt at using novel techniques borrowed from
data science to automate the model building process, and build precursors of
candidate Next Standard Models from data. Our "proto-models", though unmotivated 
by theoretical physics, will by construction stand the test against an entire deluge 
of LHC data. Once our machinery found and identified such proto-models do we bother 
with asking ourselves about the fundamental physics behind the data. 
We thus put the question of which fundamental symmetries and principles 
stand behind BSM physics at the *end* of our reasoning, rather than at the beginning.
