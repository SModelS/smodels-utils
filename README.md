# smodels-utils

**Welcome to the smodels-utils repository**

This is a repository to store and preserve codes and data *around* [SModelS](http://github.com/SModelS/smodels) that are not actual part of smodels-proper.

> [!CAUTION]
> **The code in this repository is public but not published and comes with no guarantees. Your mileage may vary!**

**Among the tools in this repository you will find:**

* code to validate the smodels-database, see [Validation](https://smodels.github.io/docs/Validation): [./validation](./validation)
* code to facilitate adding new experimental results to the database: [./smodels_utils/dataPreparation](./smodels_utils/dataPreparation/)

**In addition this repository contains:**

* code to automatically produce many of the wiki pages on [https://smodels.github.io](https://smodels.github.io) in markdown syntax
* code to port fastlim results to smodels: [./fastlim_tools](./fastlim_tools/)  
* code to write bibtex files with all analysis results, visualise and plot simplified models, and SMS results, etc etc etc (a few directories)


This current main branch is intended to work with SModelS 3.x.
