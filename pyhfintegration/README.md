# a folder for our work on integrating pyhf in SModelS

we start working on [SUSY-2018-31](https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/SUSY-2018-31/)

we start with the point (900,250,60). 
The production cross section of sbottom pair production with m=900 GeV is 12.7 fb. 
The efficiencies for this point are
